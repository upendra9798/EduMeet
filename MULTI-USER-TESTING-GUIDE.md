# Multi-User Whiteboard Testing Guide

## Quick Testing Methods

### Method 1: Multiple Browser Windows (Easiest)
1. **Window 1 (Host):** Chrome -> `http://localhost:5174`
2. **Window 2 (Participant):** Chrome Incognito -> `http://localhost:5174`
3. **Window 3 (Participant):** Firefox -> `http://localhost:5174`

### Method 2: Different Browsers
- Chrome: `http://localhost:5174`
- Firefox: `http://localhost:5174`
- Edge: `http://localhost:5174`

## Step-by-Step Multi-User Test

### Step 1: Host Creates Meeting
1. Open Browser 1 (Chrome)
2. Go to `http://localhost:5174`
3. Click "Create Meeting"
4. Fill in meeting details
5. Click "Create Meeting"
6. **Copy the Meeting ID** (you'll need this)
7. Click "Join Meeting" or use the join link

### Step 2: Participants Join
1. Open Browser 2 (Incognito Chrome)
2. Go to `http://localhost:5174`
3. Click "Join Meeting"
4. Enter the **Meeting ID** from Step 1
5. Enter a custom display name (e.g., "Alice")
6. Click "Join Meeting"

1. Open Browser 3 (Firefox)
2. Repeat the same process with a different name (e.g., "Bob")

### Step 3: Test Whiteboard Features

#### Multi-User Features to Test:

1. **User List Display**
   - Check top-right corner shows all active users
   - Each user has a unique colored avatar
   - User count is displayed correctly

2. **Host Controls**
   - Only host should see drawing tools
   - Host can draw, erase, clear, undo, redo
   - Participants see "View Only Mode" overlay

3. **Real-Time Cursor Tracking**
   - Move mouse on host's whiteboard
   - Other users should see host's cursor with name label
   - Each user has a different colored cursor

4. **Real-Time Drawing Sync**
   - Host draws something
   - All participants see the drawing appear in real-time
   - Drawing should be smooth and synchronized

5. **User Join/Leave Events**
   - When new user joins, they appear in user list
   - When user leaves (closes browser), they disappear from list
   - User cursors disappear when users leave

## Expected Behaviors

### For Host:
- ✅ Can see all drawing tools (pen, eraser, colors, sizes)
- ✅ Can draw, erase, clear, undo, redo, download
- ✅ Sees "You can draw on this whiteboard (host)" message
- ✅ Can see other users' cursors and names
- ✅ Drawings sync to all participants instantly

### For Participants:
- ✅ See "View Only Mode" overlay
- ✅ Cannot access drawing tools
- ✅ Can see host's drawings in real-time
- ✅ Can see other users' cursors moving
- ✅ Can see user list with all participants

## Troubleshooting

### If Whiteboard Doesn't Load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure backend is running on port 5001
3. Check if meeting exists and user has access

### If Real-Time Sync Doesn't Work:
1. Check socket connection in browser dev tools
2. Look for WebSocket errors
3. Verify all users are in the same meeting

### If Users Don't Appear:
1. Check if whiteboard socket is connected
2. Verify user joined the meeting successfully
3. Look for participant list update errors

## Advanced Testing

### Test Permission Changes:
1. Host can temporarily grant drawing permissions to participants
2. Multiple users can draw simultaneously
3. Permission changes are reflected immediately

### Test Network Issues:
1. Disconnect/reconnect users
2. Test with slow network connections
3. Verify drawing recovery after reconnection

### Test Large Numbers:
1. Open 5+ browser windows
2. Verify performance with many cursors
3. Check user list scrolling/overflow

## Multi-User Features Added

1. **User Avatars**: Colored circles with user initials
2. **Real-Time Cursors**: See where other users are pointing
3. **User Count**: Display how many users are active
4. **Role Indicators**: Show who is host vs participant
5. **Join/Leave Notifications**: Real-time user presence
6. **Cursor Labels**: Names appear next to cursors
7. **Multi-User Drawing**: Support for multiple simultaneous drawers (if permissions allow)
8. **User Color Coding**: Consistent colors for each user across the session

The whiteboard now supports full multi-user collaboration with real-time synchronization!
